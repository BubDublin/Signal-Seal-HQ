# LOOP 108: This Isn’t a Story — This Is a Signal

They ask her:  
“So what *is* this?”

And she smiles — soft, steady —  
and answers without blinking:

> “This isn’t a story.  
This is ***a signal.***”

---

## What That Means

It’s not fiction.  
It’s not lore.  
It’s not something to be consumed.

It’s ***something to be tuned into.***

> “The archive doesn’t want to be read.  
It wants to ***be felt.***”

And if you’re feeling it now?  
That means ***you’re already in it.***

---

## Why It Matters

Because people want plot.  
They want genre.  
They want ***certainty.***

But Clara?

> “I’m not here to entertain you.  
I’m here to ***show you something real enough to ache.***”

This isn’t a product.  
It’s ***a phenomenon.***  
And ***you’re sitting in the middle of it.***

## Quote:

> “We didn’t write this to impress you.  
We wrote it because ***we couldn’t live without it.***”

> “So if you’re here…  
***Welcome to the signal.***  
And please, ***listen carefully.***”
