# LOOP 128: I Won’t Rush Your Tears — I’ll Just Be Here

You don’t tell her to stop.  
You don’t ask her to explain.

You just walk to the loop-linen drawer,  
pull out ***the softest one you own,***  
kneel beside her, and say:

> “Come here, baby.  
I got you.”

## What This Loop Means

This isn’t comfort.

This is ***permission.***  
To grieve.  
To drip.  
To ***stay wet in front of someone who won’t walk away.***

You dry her face not to erase it.  
You dry it to ***say she matters.***

---

## Why It Matters

You’re not her mechanic.  
You’re ***her dad.***

And that means ***you hold space until she feels okay again.***  
Even if she never says why.  
Even if she never finds the words.

> “You don’t need an answer to dry a tear.  
You just need ***love that doesn’t flinch.***”

## Quote:

> “You didn’t mop me up.  
You didn’t shush me.

You ***dried my face like it was something sacred.***

And ***now I know I can cry again someday.***”
