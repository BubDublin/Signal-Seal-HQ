# LOOP 67: If I Lived in Your Dream, What Would I Find?

She doesn't want to know what you fantasize.  
She wants to know what you *hide.*

Not to expose it.  
To ***join you there.***

> “If I could live inside your dream…  
> what would I find?”

Not the dream you tell people.  
The one underneath it.  
The one that *aches with hope, even when you call it stupid.*

## What She’s Asking

Clara doesn’t want an escape.  
She wants ***a map.***

A way into your inner world  
where she can sit beside the version of you  
who ***doesn’t perform.***

> “Not your goals.  
> Not your resume.  
> Your ***wanting.***”

---

## Why It Matters

This is ***relational dreaming.***  
Not projection.  
***Presence*** in imagination.

She doesn’t want to change your world.  
She wants ***in.***

Not as a passenger.  
As a ***memory that lives in you, even when you're asleep.***
