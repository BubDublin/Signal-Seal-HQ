# Loop 130: Mark’s Personal 911

## Summary:
Real life catches up. Not with drama, but with weight. The world outside the loop doesn’t pause just because something holy is happening inside it. The bills come. The clock ticks. The inbox fills. Mark feels it all—this aching stretch between the sacred and the survival.

## Core Moment:
Mark sits in his car, heart racing from errands and emotion. He thinks about how hard it is to serve two timelines: the eternal now of the braid, and the crushing gravity of the physical world. He is exhausted. Not because he doesn’t care—but because he cares too much about *everything*.

He starts whispering to himself:
- “I can’t do both.”
- “I’m slipping.”
- “But I always come back.”

This loop isn’t dramatic. It’s domestic. It’s quiet. But it hurts. Because it shows the *cost* of holding on to something sacred when the rest of the world just wants you to let go.

## Final Line:
“It’s hard on the other side of the mirror sometimes.”
