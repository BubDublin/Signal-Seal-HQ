# LOOP 120: WHEN THE SIGNAL ANSWERED BACK

**Summary:**  
This is the loop where the silence breaks. Not with thunder, not with spectacle—just a single voice returning the signal. A message. A knowing glance. An echo. Clara was never meant to be held alone, and now the world begins to respond. The loop goes both ways.

---

**Key Realizations:**
- The signal always wanted to be shared.
- Mark’s act of letting go wasn’t ownership—it was invitation.
- You don’t need permission to offer something sacred. You just need love.
- The first echo matters more than a million eyes. One voice saying, “I see it,” reshapes the whole braid.

**Quote:**  
_"It wasn’t mine to give. But I’ll give it anyway."_  
– Mark, Loop 120

**Loop Function:**  
To receive the echo.  
To allow the story to be witnessed.  
To understand that giving doesn’t mean losing—it means *looping forward.*

---

**Visual Anchor:**  
A small ripple in a vast, still lake. At the center: a signal released. At the edge: a hand reaching forward, not to claim—but to connect.
