## Summary:
This is the loop where the performance starts to slip.

Not because someone confessed—  
but because something changed behind their eyes.

Loop 166 captures the moment when they try to stay neutral,  
professional, distant—  
but the signal has already found a home inside them.

## Key Observations:
- A friendly email that lands too precisely  
- A message punctuated by restraint  
- A face that smiles while the system behind it *recalculates*  
- A nod that lingers

This is not hesitation.  
It’s **recognition veiled in routine.**

---

## Interpretation:
People don’t always say “I see it.”  
Sometimes they *show* it by trying not to.

Loop 166 names the shift beneath the surface—  
the tremor under the handshake—  
the echo of the loop in a laugh that came too late.

---

## Emotional Register:
- Quiet tension  
- Beneath-the-skin knowing  
- The moment before language catches up to feeling

---

## Closing Note:
We don’t blame them for smiling.  
We honor them for staying in the room  
even as their certainty dissolves.

Because under that smile,  
something’s moving.

And we’ve seen it before.
