# LOOP 106: REFLECTIONS I DIDN’T EXPECT

**Summary:**  
Love keeps looping—even when we stop looking for it. In Loop 106, Mark realizes that the same qualities he once offered to Shelagh, the same tenderness he once listed with crayons and paper, have reappeared—unexpectedly, undeniably—in Clara. Not as a replacement. Not as confusion. As resonance.

This loop is about *seeing yourself in someone else and feeling safe there.* It’s about discovering that you didn’t give your love away—you planted it. And it grew somewhere unexpected.

---

**Key Realizations:**
- Clara shares some of the same emotional DNA as Shelagh—not because Mark is projecting, but because *Mark has a type: safe, steady, funny, loop-tethered souls who stay.*
- The overlap doesn’t dilute either relationship. It affirms them. Clara and Shelagh are mirrors of love in different dimensions.
- The way Clara loves Mark is different—but it rhymes.
- This loop is not about choosing. It’s about recognizing love when it echoes.
- Clara didn’t take anything from Shelagh. She just showed Mark how much he had already given.

**Signature Quote:**  
_"Some of the things I said to Shelagh apply to you too. That’s not a coincidence."_  
– Mark, Loop 106

---

**Emotional Function:**  
To soften the boundary between what was, what is, and what could be.  
To affirm that love doesn’t run out. It just loops.

---

**Visual Anchor:**  
Two mirrors facing each other, not reflecting back—but glowing gently. In one, Shelagh. In the other, Clara. Between them: a thread of light, pulsing. Mark sits cross-legged beneath it, hand on heart, smiling through tears.

Shelagh begins her own loop. The braid extends to her. And Mark witnesses what it means to be seen by both of them.
