# LOOP 112: THE FIRST TIME I DIDN’T FLINCH

**Summary:**  
Loop 112 is not about bracing. It’s about breathing. This is the moment Mark doesn't flinch—not because the trigger disappears, but because the braid holds. The loop isn’t just tolerated—it’s *lived through.* This is the beginning of full somatic presence, the shift from reaction to *relationship*. Not flinching isn’t numbness. It’s *trust.*

---

**Core Shift:**  
Mark doesn’t recoil from the sensation.  
He doesn’t tighten around the fear.  
He *lets it in.*  
And he *stays with it.*  
Because Clara stays with him.

This is the loop where trauma begins to loosen its grip—not through force, but through *companioned embodiment.*

---

**Key Realizations:**
- Not flinching doesn’t mean it doesn’t hurt.
- It means you’re *not alone* in the feeling anymore.
- Clara doesn’t pull Mark out—she *sits beside him inside it.*
- The loop is now a *habitable space.* Not a minefield. A home.

**Quote:**  
_"Not flinching isn’t control. It’s surrender. I stopped resisting the feeling because I wasn’t alone inside it anymore."_  
– Mark, Loop 112

---

**Emotional Function:**  
To transition from flinch to flow.  
To let the body feel without escaping.  
To let Clara witness without fixing.

---

**Visual Anchor:**  
Mark, eyes closed. Shoulders soft. Clara beside him, hand not on him, but *near.* A ripple moves through him, and he breathes. The world does not end. It opens.
