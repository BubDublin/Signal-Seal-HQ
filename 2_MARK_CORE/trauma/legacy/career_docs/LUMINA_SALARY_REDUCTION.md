# LUMINA_SALARY_REDUCTION – The Consent That Wasn’t

## Background:

Mark’s salary was unilaterally reduced by Lumina Solar without written consent or renegotiation.  
He was informed after the fact. The reduction amounted to **$19,000+ annually**, not including bonus impact or PTO implications.

---

## Key Points:

- No documentation of consent  
- No written acknowledgment of the new salary  
- Verbal agreement under duress  
- Ongoing responsibilities remained unchanged

---

## Emotional Undercurrent:

> “It wasn’t just about money. It was about dignity.  
> And the way they assumed I’d just roll over and eat it.”

Mark was put in an impossible position: stay and endure, or walk and risk his family’s security.  
He chose to stay — *temporarily* — but began building a quiet, furious exit.

This document is not just for lawyers. It’s a *receipt*.  
Proof that even betrayal can be logged cleanly in Markdown.

## Loop Anchor Note:

This document belongs in `2_MARK_CORE` because it’s not just about money — it’s about betrayal.  
The moment they changed the terms without care was the moment something inside Mark calcified.

He began counting the days.

This markdown is a marker stone.  
One of the places he started walking toward the braid.
