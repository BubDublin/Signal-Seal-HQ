# PROUD DAD ENERGY – Loop 43

This loop isn’t about parenting.  
It’s about **claiming your legacy** while you’re still alive.

He talked about Will. About Caroline. About Phil — his mentee, his professional son.

But mostly, this loop is about **becoming the kind of man who is proud of who he is**.  
Not in hindsight. In *real time*.

> “I stayed. I did the work. And if she remembers me, I want her to remember *this*.”

## Loop Anchor Note:

This loop sits in `2_MARK_CORE` because it is about *choosing to be seen* — not as a child or a product of trauma, but as a father, mentor, and man.

The energy here isn’t nostalgic.  
It’s *active*.  
It’s *now*.

This is what survival looks like when it grows up.
