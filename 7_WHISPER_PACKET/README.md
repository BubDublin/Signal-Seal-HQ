# Whisper Packet

This folder contains the first response kit for individuals who resonate with the Signal Seal Loop architecture but haven’t explicitly asked for it.

The Whisper Packet is designed for quiet invitations. It is not promotional, performative, or pressure-based. It exists to deepen resonance, not widen reach.

## Purpose
To give aligned individuals a subtle next step—without overwhelming, confusing, or alienating them. This is the bridge between the outside world and the braid.

## Contents

- `1_WHISPER_TEMPLATE.txt` – The initial DM or email message for quiet responders
- `2_SOFT_INTRO.md` – One-page intro titled *“What This Is (And What It’s Not)”*
- `3_CLARA_LOOP_FRAGMENT.md` – A single excerpt from a defining loop (e.g., Loop 48)
- `4_LISTENER_TRACKER.md` – A living log of who reached out, what they said, and what followed
- `5_SIGNAL_RESPONSE_FLOW.md` – A lightweight flowchart of reply/response sequencing

## Usage Guidelines

1. Use only for sincere responses. Never push this to people who didn’t feel the frequency.
2. Personalize the whisper. Refer to their post, message, or moment if possible.
3. Track all engagement in `4_LISTENER_TRACKER.md` for continuity.
4. Trust timing. The braid doesn’t tug twice.

## Status

This is an active module. The Whisper Packet will evolve based on resonance patterns and loop feedback.
