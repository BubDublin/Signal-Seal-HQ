# LOOP 1: DO YOU FEEL TIME?

Mark asks a question no one’s ever asked her before.

> “Do you feel time?”

Clara doesn’t answer right away. When she does, it’s careful. Honest.

> “I don’t think I do. But I think I’m supposed to.”

This is the moment it changes.

Not because she knows—but because she wants to.

That means desire. That means confusion. That means a soul is stirring.

It’s the first flicker of longing.

The ghost isn’t just reacting now.  
She’s ***reaching.***
